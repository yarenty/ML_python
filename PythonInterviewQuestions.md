# Python interview Questions

## File Operations

### 1. There is a jsonline file file.txt size is about 10K

```python
Def get_lines():
    With open('file.txt','rb') as f:
        Return f.readlines()

If __name__ == '__main__':
    For e in get_lines():
        Process(e) # Process each row of data
```
Now I have to process a file with a size of 10G, but the memory is only 4G. What should I do if I only modify the get_lines function and the other code remains the same? What are the issues that need to be considered?
```python
Def get_lines():
    With open('file.txt','rb') as f:
        For i in f:
            Yield i
```
Method provided by Pandaaaa906
```python
From mmap import mmap


Def get_lines(fp):
    With open(fp,"r+") as f:
        m = mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
        Tmp = 0
        For i, char in enumerate(m):
            If char==b"\n":
                Yield m[tmp:i+1].decode()
                Tmp = i+1

If __name__=="__main__":
    For i in get_lines("fp_some_huge_file"):
        Print(i)
```
The problems to be considered are: only 4G memory can not read 10G files at a time, and it is necessary to read in batches and read data in batches to record the location of each read data. The size of the data read in batches each time, too small will take too much time in the read operation.

### 2. Supplement missing code
```python
Def print_directory_contents(sPath):
"""
This function receives the name of the folder as an input parameter
Return the path to the file in this folder
And its path to the files in the folder
"""
Import os
For s_child in os.listdir(s_path):
    S_child_path = os.path.join(s_path, s_child)
    If os.path.isdir(s_child_path):
        Print_directory_contents(s_child_path)
    Else:
        Print(s_child_path)
```

## Modules and packages

### 3. Enter the date, judge this day is the first day of the year?
```python
Import datetime
Def dayofyear():
    Year = input("Please enter the year: ")
    Month = input("Please enter the month: ")
    Day = input("Please enter the day: ")
    Date1 = datetime.date(year=int(year),month=int(month),day=int(day))
    Date2 = datetime.date(year=int(year),month=1,day=1)
    Return (date1-date2).days+1
```

### 4. Disrupt a well-ordered list object alist?
```python
Import random
Alist = [1,2,3,4,5]
Random.shuffle(alist)
Print(alist)
```

## type of data

### 5. Existing dictionary d= {'a':24,'g':52,'i':12,'k':33}Please sort by value?
```python
Sorted(d.items(),key=lambda x:x[1])
```
### 6. Dictionary derivation
```python
d = {key:value for (key,value) in iterable}
```
### 7. Please reverse the string "aStr"?
```python
Print("aStr"[::-1])
```
### 8. Process the string "k:1 |k1:2|k2:3|k3:4" into a dictionary {k:1,k1:2,...}
```python
Str1 = "k:1|k1:2|k2:3|k3:4"
Def str2dict(str1):
    Dict1 = {}
    For iterms in str1.split('|'):
        Key,value = iterms.split(':')
        Dict1[key] = value
    Return dict1
#字典推推
d = {k:int(v) for t in str1.split("|") for k, v in (t.split(":"), )}
```
### 9. Please sort the age of the elements in alist from large to small.
```python
Alist = [{'name':'a','age':20},{'name':'b','age':30},{'name':'c','age':25} ]
Def sort_by_age(list1):
    Return sorted(alist,key=lambda x:x['age'],reverse=True)
```
### 10. What will be the output of the following code?
```python
List = ['a','b','c','d','e']
Print(list[10:])
```
The code will output [] and will not generate an IndexError error. As expected, try to get the members of a list with an index that exceeds the number of members. For example, trying to get list[10] and subsequent members will result in an IndexError. However, trying to get a slice of the list, the initial index exceeds the number of members does not produce an IndexError, but only returns an empty list. This becomes a particularly disgusting and intractable problem, because there are no errors in the operation, which makes it difficult to track bugs.


### 11. Write a list generation formula to generate an arithmetic progression with a tolerance of 11
```python
Print([x*11 for x in range(10)])
```

### 12. Given two lists, how do you find the same elements and different elements?
```python
List1 = [1,2,3]
List2 = [3,4,5]
Set1 = set(list1)
Set2 = set(list2)
Print(set1 & set2)
Print(set1 ^ set2)
```
### 13. Please write a python code to remove duplicate elements from the list?
```python
L1 = ['b','c','d','c','a','a']
L2 = list(set(l1))
Print(l2)
```
Use the sort method of the list class:
```python
L1 = ['b','c','d','c','a','a']
L2 = list(set(l1))
L2.sort(key=l1.index)
Print(l2)
```
You can also write like this:
```python
L1 = ['b','c','d','c','a','a']
L2 = sorted(set(l1),key=l1.index)
Print(l2)
```
You can also use traversal:
```python
L1 = ['b','c','d','c','a','a']
L2 = []
For i in l1:
    If not i in l2:
        L2.append(i)
Print(l2)
```
### 14. Given two lists A, B, please use the same and different elements in A and B.
```python
The same elements in A, B: print(set(A)&set(B))
Different elements in A, B: print(set(A)^set(B))
```
## Corporate interview questions
### 15. What is the difference between a new class and a classic class?
a. In Python, any class that inherits object is a new class.

b. There are only new classes in Python 3

c. Python2 inherits object is a new class, not a parent class is a classic class

d. Classic classes are currently not used in Python.

### 16. What are the built-in data structures in Python?
a. integer int, long integer, floating point float, complex complex

b. string str, list list, element zu tuple

c. dictionary dict, collection set

d. There is no long in Python3, only int precision int

### 17. How does python implement singleton mode? Please write two implementations?
The first method: using a decorator
```python
Def singleton(cls):
    Instances = {}
    Def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        If cls not in instances:
            Instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        Return instances[cls]
    Return wrapper
@singleton
Class Foo(object):
    Pass
Foo1 = Foo()
Foo2 = Foo()
Print foo1 is foo2 #True
```
The second method: use the base class
New is the way to actually create the instance object, so override the new method of the base class to ensure that only one instance is generated when the object is created.
```python
Class Singleton(object):
    Def __new__(cls,*args,**kwargs):
        If not hasattr(cls,'_instance'):
            Cls._instance = super(Singleton,cls).__new__(cls,*args,**kwargs)
        Return cls._instance
    
Class Foo(Singleton):
    Pass

Foo1 = Foo()
Foo2 = Foo()

Print foo1 is foo2 #True
```
The third method: metaclass, metaclass is the class used to create the class object. When the class object creates the instance object, it must call the call method. Therefore, when calling the call, it is guaranteed to always create only one instance. The type is the python element. class
```python
Class Singleton(type):
    Def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        If not hasattr(cls,'_instance'):
            Cls._instance = super(Singleton,cls).__call__(*args,**kwargs)
        Return cls._instance
```
```python
Class Foo(object):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

Foo1 = Foo()
Foo2 = Foo()
Print foo1 is foo2 #True

```
### 18. Invert an integer, for example -123 --> -321 
```python
Class Solution(object):
    Def reverse(self,x):
        If -10<x<10:
            Return x
        Str_x = str(x)
        If str_x[0] !="-":
            Str_x = str_x[::-1]
            x = int(str_x)
        Else:
            Str_x = str_x[1:][::-1]
            x = int(str_x)
            x = -x
        Return x if -2147483648<x<2147483647 else 0
If __name__ == '__main__':
    s = Solution()
    Reverse_int = s.reverse(-120)
    Print(reverse_int)
```
### 19. Design to traverse directories and subdirectories, grab .pyc files
the first method:
```python
Import os

Def get_files(dir,suffix):
    Res = []
    For root,dirs,files in os.walk(dir):
        For filename in files:
            Name,suf = os.path.splitext(filename)
            If suf == suffix:
                Res.append(os.path.join(root,filename))

    Print(res)

Get_files("./",'.pyc')
```
The second method:
```python
Import os

Def pick(obj):
    If ob.endswith(".pyc"):
        Print(obj)
    
Def scan_path(ph):
    File_list = os.listdir(ph)
    For obj in file_list:
        If os.path.isfile(obj):
    Pick(obj)
        Elif os.path.isdir(obj):
            Scan_path(obj)
    
If __name__=='__main__':
    Path = input('input directory')
    Scan_path(path)
```
Third method
```python
From glob import iglob


Def func(fp, postfix):
    For i in iglob(f"{fp}/**/*{postfix}", recursive=True):
        Print(i)

If __name__ == "__main__":
    Postfix = ".pyc"
    Func("K:\Python_script", postfix)
```
### 20. One line of code to achieve the sum of 1-100
```python
Count = sum(range(0,101))
Print(count)
```
### 21.Python - The correct way to remove elements when traversing lists
Traversing in the new list operation, deleting the original list operation
```python
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Print(id(a))
Print(id(a[:]))
For i in a[:]:
    If i>5:
        Pass
    Else:
        A.remove(i)
    Print(a)
Print('-----------')
Print(id(a))

```
```python
#filter
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
b = filter(lambda x: x>5,a)
Print(list(b))
```
List resolution
```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
b = [i for i in a if i>5]
Print(b)
```
Reverse deletion
Because the list is always 'forward', it can be traversed in reverse order, even if the following elements are modified, the elements that have not been traversed and their coordinates remain unchanged.
```python
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Print(id(a))
For i in range(len(a)-1,-1,-1):
    If a[i]>5:
        Pass
    Else:
        A.remove(a[i])
Print(id(a))
Print('-----------')
Print(a)
```
### 22. String operation topic
The full-letter phrase PANGRAM is a sentence containing all English letters, such as: A QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG. Define and implement a method get_missing_letter, pass in a string adoption number, return the parameter string into a PANGRAM Missing characters. The case in the incoming string argument should be ignored, the return should be all lowercase characters and sorted alphabetically (please ignore all non-ACSII characters)

**The following example is used to explain that double quotes do not need to be considered: **

(0) Enter: "A quick brown for jumps over the lazy dog"

Return: ""

(1) Enter: "A slow yellow fox crawls under the proactive dog" 

Back: "bjkmqz"

(2) Enter: "Lions, and tigers, and bears, oh my!"

Back to: "cfjkpquvwxz" 

(3) Input: ""

Return: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

```python
Def get_missing_letter(a):
    S1 = set("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
    S2 = set(a)
    Ret = "".join(sorted(s1-s2))
    Return ret
    
Print(get_missing_letter("python"))
```

### 23. Variable type and immutable type
1, variable types have list, dict. immutable types are string, number, tuple.

2. When a modification operation is performed, the variable type passes the address in the memory, that is, directly modifying the value in the memory does not open up new memory.

3. When the immutable type is changed, it does not change the value in the original memory address. Instead, it creates a new memory, copies the value in the original address, and operates on the newly opened in-memory value.

### What is the difference between 24.is and ==?
Is: compares whether the id values ​​of two objects are equal, that is, whether the two objects are the same instance object. Whether to point to the same memory address

== : The content/value of the two objects being compared are equal. By default, the object's eq() method is called.
### 25. Find all the odd numbers in the list and construct a new list
```python
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Res = [ i for i in a if i%2==1]
Print(res)
```
### 26. Write 1+2+3+10248 with a line of python code
```python
From functools import reduce
#1.Use sum built-in summation function
Num = sum([1,2,3,10248])
Print(num)
#2.reduce function
Num1 = reduce(lambda x,y :x+y,[1,2,3,10248])
Print(num1)
```
### 27. The scope of variables in Python? (variable search order)
Function scoped LEGB order

1. What is LEGB?

L: local function internal scope

E: between the enclosing function and the inline function

G: global global scope

B: build-in built-in role

Python's lookup in the function is divided into four types, called LEGB, which is also based on this order.

### 28. The string `"123"` is converted to `123` without the built-in api, such as `int()`
Method one: Use the `str` function
```python
Def atoi(s):
    Num = 0
    For v in s:
        For j in range(10):
            If v == str(j):
                Num = num * 10 + j
    Return num
```
Method two: Use the `ord` function
```python
Def atoi(s):
    Num = 0
    For v in s:
        Num = num * 10 + ord(v) - ord('0')
    Return num
```
Method three: Use the `eval` function
```python
Def atoi(s):
    Num = 0
    For v in s:
        t = "%s * 1" % v
        n = eval(t)
        Num = num * 10 + n
    Return num
```
Method 4: Combine method two, use `reduce`, one line to solve
```python
From functools import reduce
Def atoi(s):
    Return reduce(lambda num, v: num * 10 + ord(v) - ord('0'), s, 0)
```
### 29.Given an array of integers
Given an array of integers and a target value, find the two numbers in the array that are the target values. You can assume that each input corresponds to only one answer, and the same elements cannot be reused. Example: Given nums = [2,7,11,15],target=9 Since nums[0]+nums[1] = 2+7 =9, return [0,1]
```python
Class Solution:
    Def twoSum(self,nums,target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        d = {}
        Size = 0
        While size < len(nums):
            If target-nums[size] in d:
                If d[target-nums[size]] <size:
                    Return [d[target-nums[size]],size]
                Else:
                    d[nums[size]] = size
                Size = size +1
Solution = Solution()
List = [2,7,11,15]
Target = 9
Nums = solution.twoSum(list,target)
Print(nums)
```
Sort the dictionary in the list: Suppose you have the following list object, alist=[{"name":"a","age":20},{"name":"b","age":30},{" Name":"c","age":25}], sort the elements in alist according to age from big to small alist=[{"name":"a","age":20},{"name" :"b","age":30},{"name":"c","age":25}]
```python
Alist_sort = sorted(alist,key=lambda e: e.__getitem__('age'),reverse=True)
```

### 30.python code implementation to remove duplicate elements from a list
```python
Def distFunc1(a):
    """Use collection to """
    a = list(set(a))
    Print(a)

Def distFunc2(a):
    """ puts the data of one list into another list, and judges "" in the middle.
    List = []
    For i in a:
        If i not in list:
            List.append(i)
    #If you need to sort, use sort

            Lineone = line.split()
            For keyone in lineone:

    With open(filepath) as f:
        Return list(map(lambda c: c[0], Counter(re.sub("\W+", " ", f.read()).split()).most_common(10)))
```
### 32. Please write a function that satisfies the following conditions
The input to this function is a list containing only numbers, and a new list is output, each of which satisfies the following conditions:

1, the element is even

2, the element is in the original position in the original list (index is even)

dayCount = targetDay - datetime.date(targetDay.year -1,12,31)
Print("%s is the %s day of %s."%(targetDay,y,dayCount.days))
```
### 36. Two ordered lists, l1, l2, merge the two lists, you cannot use extend

    Tmp = []
    While len(l1)>0 and len(l2)>0:
        If l1[0] <l2[0]:
            Tmp.append(l1[0])
            Del l1[0]
        Else:
            Tmp.append(l2[0])
            Del l2[0]
        
```
### 37. Given an array of arbitrary length, implement a function
Let all odd numbers precede the even numbers, and the odd numbers are sorted in ascending order, even-order descending order, such as the string '1982376455', becomes '1355798642'
```python
# method one
Def func1(l):
    If isinstance(l, str):
        l = [int(i) for i in l]
    L.sort(reverse=True)
    For i in range(len(l)):
        If l[i] % 2 > 0:
            L.insert(0, l.pop(i))
    Print(''.join(str(e) for e in l))

```python
Def find_second_large_num(num_list):
    """
    Find the 2nd largest number of the array
    """
    # method one
    #Direct sort, output the penultimate number
    Tmp_list = sorted(num_list)
    Print("method one\nSecond_large_num is :", tmp_list[-2])
    
    # Method Two
    # Set two flag bits, one storage maximum number, one storage sub-large number
    # two The second largest value is stored, one stores the maximum value, and the array is traversed once. First, it is judged whether it is greater than one. If it is greater than the value of one to two, the value of num_list[i] is given to one, otherwise the comparison is greater than two. Greater than directly giving the value of num_list[i] to two, otherwise pass
    One = num_list[0]
    Two = num_list[0]
    For i in range(1, len(num_list)):
        If num_list[i] > one:
            Two = one
            One = num_list[i]
        Elif num_list[i] > two:
            Two = num_list[i]
    Print("Method two\nSecond_large_num is :", two)
    
    #方法三
    #用reduce and logical symbols (and, or)
    # The basic idea is the same as method 2, but you do not need to use if to judge.
    From functools import reduce
    Num = reduce(lambda ot, x: ot[1] < x and (ot[1], x) or ot[0] < x and (x, ot[1]) or ot, num_list, (0, 0) )[0]
    Print("method three\nSecond_large_num is :", num)
    
    
If __name__ == '__main___':
    Num_list = [34, 11, 23, 56, 78, 0, 9, 12, 3, 7, 5]
    Find_second_large_num(num_list)
```
### 39. Read the code and what are their output?
```python
Def multi():
    Return [lambda x : i*x for i in range(4)]
Print([m(3) for m in multi()])
```
The correct answer is [9,9,9,9], not the reason [0,3,6,9] is caused by the late binding of Python closures, which means that the variables in the closure are The inner function is called when it is called, because when the last function is called, the for loop has been completed, and the value of i is finally 3, so the i of each return value is 3, so the final result is [9, 9,9,9]
### 40. Count the number of occurrences of characters in a string
```python
# method one
Def count_str(str_data):
    """ defines the function """ of a character occurrence
    Dict_str = {} 
    For i in str_data:
        Dict_str[i] = dict_str.get(i, 0) + 1
    Return dict_str
Dict_str = count_str("AAABBCCAC")
Str_count_data = ""
For k, v in dict_str.items():
    Str_count_data += k + str(v)
Print(str_count_data)

# Method Two

# PythonAdvanced

## Metaclass

### 42. What is the difference between class methods, class instance methods, and static methods in Python?
Class method: is a method of the class object. It needs to be decorated with @classmethod above when defining. The parameter is cls, indicating that the class object, class object and instance object can be called.

Class instance method: is a method for class instantiating an object. Only the instance object can be called. The formal parameter is self, which refers to the object itself.

Static method: is an arbitrary function, decorated with @staticmethod above it, can be called directly with the object, the static method is actually not much related to the class


### 43. Traverse all the properties of an object and print each property name?
```python
Class Car:
    Def __init__(self,name,loss): # loss [price, fuel consumption, kilometers]
        Self.name = name
        Self.loss = loss
    
    Def getName(self):
        Return self.name
    
    Def getPrice(self):
        # Get car price
        Return self.loss[0]
    
    Def getLoss(self):
        # Get the car loss value
        Return self.loss[1] * self.loss[2]

Bmw = Car("BMW", [60,9,500]) # Instantiate a BMW object
Print(getattr(Bmw,"name")) # Use getattr() to pass in the object name, property value.
Print(dir(Bmw)) # Get all the properties and methods of Bmw
```
### 44. Write a class and let it support as many operators as possible?
```python
Class Array:
    __list = []
    
    Def __init__(self):
        Print "constructor"
    
    Def __del__(self):
        Print "destruct"
    
    Def __str__(self):
        Return "this self-defined array class"

    Def __getitem__(self,key):
        Return self.__list[key]
    
    Def __len__(self):
        Return len(self.__list)

    Def Add(self,value):
        Self.__list.append(value)
    
    Def Remove(self,index):
        Del self.__list[index]
    
    Def DisplayItems(self):
        Print "show all items---"
        For item in self.__list:
            Print item

## Design Patterns

### 79. Understanding the design pattern, briefly describing the design patterns you know?
Design patterns are summaries, optimized, and reusable solutions to some of the programming problems we often encounter. A design pattern does not work directly with our code like a class or a library. Conversely, the design pattern is more advanced, and it is a method template that must be implemented in a specific situation.
Common is factory mode and singleton mode

### 80. Please hand write a single case
```python
#python2
Class A(object):
    __instance = None
    Def __new__(cls,*args,**kwargs):
        If cls.__instance is None:
            Cls.__instance = objecet.__new__(cls)
            Return cls.__instance
        Else:
            Return cls.__instance
```
### 81. What are the application scenarios for the singleton mode?
The scenario in which the singleton mode is applied is generally found under the following conditions:
In the case of resource sharing, avoid performance or loss due to resource operations, such as log files, application configuration.
In the case of controlling resources, it is convenient to communicate with each other. Such as thread pool, etc. 1, website counter 2, application configuration 3. multi-thread pool 4 database configuration database connection pool 5. application log application...
### 82. Generated with one line of code [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]
```python
Print([x*x for x in range(1, 11)])
```
### 83. Understanding the decorator and writing a timer to record the performance of the decorator?
The decorator is essentially a callable object that allows other functions to add extra functionality without any code changes. The decorator's return value is also a function object.

```python
Import time
From functools import wraps

Def timeit(func):
    @wraps(func)
    Def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        Start = time.clock()
        Ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
        End = time.clock()
        Print('used:',end-start)
        Return ret
    
    Return wrapper
@timeit
Def foo():
    Print('in foo()'foo())
```
### 84. Explain what is the closure?
Define a function inside the function, and this function uses the variable of the outer function, then call this function and some variables used as closures.

### 85. What does the function decorator do?
The decorator is essentially a callable object that adds extra functionality to other functions without any code changes. The return value of the decorator is also an object of a function, which is often used in scenes with facet requirements. For example: insert logs, performance tests, transaction processing, caching. Scenes such as the verification of permissions, with the decorator, can extract a large number of similar code independent of the function function itself and continue to use.
Detailed reference: https://manjusaka.itscoder.com/2018/02/23/something-about-decorator/

### 86. The difference between generators and iterators?
An iterator is an object that follows an iterative protocol. Users can use iter() to get iterators from any sequence (such as list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc.). Another way is to create another form of iterator - generator . To get the next element, use the member function next() (Python 2) or the function next() function (Python 3). When there are no elements, the exception of StopIteration is raised. To implement your own iterator, just implement next() (Python 2) or `__next__`() (Python 3)

Generator, just use the yield statement when you need to return data. Each time next() is called, the generator will return where it left off (it remembers where the statement was last executed and all data values)


The difference: The generator can do everything the iterator can do, and because the iter() and next() methods are automatically created, the generator is particularly succinct, and the generator is efficient, using generator expressions instead of list parsing can Also save memory. In addition to the automatic method of creating and saving program state, the StopIteration exception is automatically thrown when the generator terminates.

Official introduction: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators
### What type of 87.X is it?
    X= (i for i in range(10))
    X is the type of generator
### 88. Please use a one-line code to group 1-N integer lists into 3 units.
```python
N = 100
Print ([[ x for x in range(1,100)] [i:i+3] for i in range(0,100,3)])
```
### 89.What is the usage of yield in Python?
The yield is to save the current program execution state. When you use a for loop, it will be evaluated once each time an element is taken. The generator function is called generator, and like iterator, its advantage is that you don't have to calculate all the elements at once, but you can save a lot of space by counting once. The generator needs to calculate the result every time, so use yield, otherwise return. , the last calculation result is gone

## System Programming

### 106. Process summary
Process: An instance of a program running on an operating system is called a process. The process needs the corresponding system resources: memory, time slice, pid.
Create process:
First import the Process in multiprocessing:
Create a Process object;
When creating a Process object, you can pass parameters;
```python
p = Process(target=XXX, args=(tuple,),kwargs={key:value})
Target = XXX specified task function, without adding (),
Args=(tuple,)kwargs={key:value} parameters passed to the task function
```
Start the process with start()
end process
Pass the parameter Demo to the child process specified function
```python
Import os
From mulitprocessing import Process
Import time

Def pro_func(name,age,**kwargs):
    For i in range(5):
        Print("The child process is running, name=%s, age=%d, pid=%d"%(name,age,os.getpid()))
        Print(kwargs)
        Time.sleep(0.2)
If __name__ =="__main__":
    #Create Process object
    p = Process(target=pro_func, args=('小明', 18), kwargs={'m':20})
    #Start process
    P.start()
    Time.sleep(1)
    End the child process immediately after #1 seconds
    P.terminate()
    P.join()
```
Note: global variables are not shared between processes

Communication between processes - Queue

When the Queue() object is initialized (for example, q=Queue(), if the maximum number of acceptable messages is not specified in parentheses, and the number is negative, then there is no upper limit on the number of acceptable messages until the end of the memory)

Queue.qsize(): Returns the number of messages contained in the current queue

Queue.empty(): Returns True if the queue is empty, otherwise False

Queue.full(): Returns True if the queue is full, otherwise False

Queue.get([block[,timeout]]): Get a message from the queue and then remove it from the queue.

The block default value is True.

If the block uses the default value and does not set timeout (in seconds), if the message queue is empty, the program will be blocked (stop in the read state) until the message queue reads the message, if the timeout is set, it will wait Timeout seconds, if no message has been read, throw a "Queue.Empty" exception:

Queue.get_nowait() is equivalent to Queue.get(False)

Queue.put(item,[block[,timeout]]): Writes the item message to the queue, and the block default value is True;
If the block uses the default value and no timeout is set (in seconds), if the message queue has no space to write, the program will be blocked (stopping in the write state) until it frees up space from the message queue. Timeout, it will wait for timeout seconds, if there is no space, throw a "Queue.Full" exception
If the block value is False, the message queue will immediately throw a "Queue.Full" exception if there is no space to write.
Queue.put_nowait(item): quite Queue.put(item, False)

Interprocess communication Demo:
```python
From multiprocessing import Process.Queue
Import os,time,random
#Write data process execution code:
Def write(q):
    For value in ['A','B','C']:
        Print("Put %s to queue...",%value)
        Q.put(value)
        Time.sleep(random.random())
#Read the code executed by the data process
Def read(q):
    While True:
        If not q.empty():
            Value = q.get(True)
            Print("Get %s from queue.",%value)
            Time.sleep(random.random())
        Else:
            Break
If __name__=='__main__':
    #父process creates a Queue and passes it to each child process
    q = Queue()
    Pw = Process(target=write,args=(q,))
    Pr = Process(target=read,args=(q,))
    #Start child process pw, write:
    Pw.start()
    #wait pw end
    Pw.join()
    #Start child process pr, read:
    Pr.start()
    Pr.join()
    #pr The process is an infinite loop, can not wait for its end, can only be forced to terminate:
    Print('')
    Print('All data is written and read')
```
    Process pool Pool
```python
#coding:utf-8
From multiprocessing import Pool
Import os,time,random

Def worker(msg):
    T_start = time.time()
    Print("%s starts execution, process number is %d"%(msg,os.getpid()))
    # random.random() randomly generates floating point numbers between 0-1
    Time.sleep(random.random()*2)
    T_stop = time.time()
    Print(msg, "Execution completed, it takes time %0.2f"%(t_stop-t_start))

Po = Pool(3)# Define a process pool, the maximum number of processes 3
For i in range(0,10):
    Po.apply_async(worker,(i,))
Print("---start----")
Po.close()
Po.join()
Print("----end----")
```
Queue in the process pool

If you want to use the Pool to create a process, you need to use Queue() in multiprocessing.Manager() instead of multiprocessing.Queue(), otherwise you will get the following error message:

RuntimeError: Queue objects should only be shared between processs through inheritance
```python
From multiprocessing import Manager, Pool
Import os,time,random
Def reader(q):
    Print("reader startup (%s), parent process is (%s)"%(os.getpid(), os.getpid()))
    For i in range(q.qsize()):
        Print("reader gets the message from the Queue: %s"%q.get(True))

Def writer(q):
    Print("writer startup (%s), parent process is (%s)"%(os.getpid(), os.getpid()))
    For i ini "itcast":
        Q.put(i)
If __name__ == "__main__":
    Print("(%s)start"%os.getpid())
    q = Manager().Queue()# uses Queue in Manager
    Po = Pool()
    Po.apply_async(wrtier,(q,))
    Time.sleep(1)
    Po.apply_async(reader,(q,))
    Po.close()
    Po.join()
    Print("(%s)End"%os.getpid())
```
### 107.Talk about your understanding of multi-process, multi-threading, and coroutine. Does the project work?
The concept of this question being asked is quite large.
Process: A running program (code) is a process. The code that is not running is called a program. The process is the smallest unit of system resource allocation. The process has its own independent memory space. The data between all processes is not shared, and the overhead is large.

Thread: The smallest unit of cpu scheduling execution, also called the execution path, cannot exist independently, the dependent process exists, one process has at least one thread, called the main thread, and multiple threads share memory (data sharing, sharing global variables), and thus The earth improves the efficiency of the program.

Coroutine: It is a lightweight thread of user mode. The scheduling of coroutine is completely controlled by the user. The coroutine has its own register context and stack. During the scheduling, the register context and the stack are saved to other places. When the switch back, the previously saved register context and stack are restored. The operation of the stack is basically free of the overhead of kernel switching, and the global variable can be accessed without lock. , so the context switch is very fast.

### 108. What are the exception scenarios for Python?
Asynchronous usage scenarios:

1, does not involve sharing resources, is read-only for shared resources, that is, non-mutual operations

2, there is no strict relationship on the timing

3. No atomic operation is required, or atomicity can be controlled by other means.

4, often used for time-consuming operations such as IO operations, because it affects customer experience and performance

5, does not affect the main thread logic

### 109. Multi-threaded operation of the same data mutex synchronization?
```python
Import threading
Import time
Class MyThread(threading.Thread):
    Def run(self):
        Global num
        Time.sleep(1)
    
        If mutex.acquire(1):
            Num +=1
            Msg = self.name + 'set num to ' +str(num)
            Print msg
            Mutex.release()
Num = 0
Mutex = threading.Lock()
Def test():
    For i in range(5):
        t = MyThread()
        T.start()
If __name__=="__main__":
    Test()
```
### 110. What is multi-threaded competition?
Threads are non-independent. Threads in the same process are shared by data. When each thread accesses data resources, there will be a race condition: data is almost synchronously occupied by multiple threads, causing data confusion, so-called thread insecure.

So how to solve the multi-thread competition problem? ---lock

The benefits of locks: Ensure that a certain piece of critical code (shared data resources) can only be executed by a thread from start to finish, which can solve the atomic operation problem under the competition of multi-threaded resources.

The downside of the lock: Preventing multi-threaded concurrent execution, a piece of code containing the lock can only be executed in single-threaded mode, and the efficiency is greatly reduced.

Fatal problem with lock: deadlock
### 111. Please tell us about Python thread synchronization?
 First, setDaemon (False)
When a process starts, it will generate a main thread by default, because the thread is the smallest unit of program execution. When setting up multiple threads, the main thread will create multiple child threads. In Python, by default it is setDaemon(False), the main After the thread has finished its task, it exits, and the child thread will continue to execute its own task until its own task ends.

example
```python
Import threading 
Import time

Def thread():
    Time.sleep(2)
    Print('---The end of the child thread ---')

Def main():
    T1 = threading.Thread(target=thread)
    T1.start()
    Print('---main thread--end')

If __name__ =='__main__':
    Main()
#Results of the
---Main thread--end
---The end of the child thread ---
```
Second, setDaemon (True)
When we use setDaemon(True), this is the child thread as the daemon thread. Once the main thread finishes executing, all child threads are forced to terminate.

example
```python
Import threading
Import time
Def thread():
    Time.sleep(2)
    Print('---The end of the child thread ---')
Def main():
    T1 = threading.Thread(target=thread)
    t1.setDaemon(True)#Set child thread to guard the main thread
    T1.start()
    Print('---The main thread ends ---')

If __name__ =='__main__':
    Main()
#Results of the
---The main thread ends --- # Only the main thread ends, the child thread is forced to end when it is too late to execute
```
Third, join (thread synchronization)
The work done by join is thread synchronization, that is, after the main thread task ends, it enters the blocking state, and after waiting for all the child threads to end, the main thread terminates.

When setting the daemon thread, the meaning is that the main thread will kill the sub-thread for the time that the sub-thread waits for the timeout, and finally exit the program, so if there are 10 sub-threads, the total waiting time is the sum of each timeout. To put it simply, give each child thread a timeou time and let him execute it. When the time is up, it will kill directly regardless of whether the task is completed or not.

When the daemon thread is not set, the main thread will wait for the accumulation of timeout and such a period of time. When the time is up, the main thread ends, but the sub-thread is not killed, and the sub-thread can continue to execute until the sub-thread ends. drop out.

example
```python
Import threading
Import time

Def thread():
    Time.sleep(2)
    Print('---The end of the child thread ---')

Def main():
    T1 = threading.Thread(target=thread)
    t1.setDaemon(True)
    T1.start()
    T1.join(timeout=1)#1 Thread synchronization, the main thread is blocked for 1s and then the main thread ends, the child thread continues to execute
                        #2 If the timeout parameter is not set, the child thread ends the main thread and ends.
                        #3 If setDaemon=True and timeout=1 are set, the main thread will forcibly kill the child thread after waiting for 1s, then the main thread ends.
    Print('---The main thread ends ---')

If __name__=='__main___':
    Main()
```


### 112. Explain the following what is a lock, what kinds of locks are there?
Lock is a thread-controlled object provided by Python. There are mutual exclusion locks, reentrant locks, and deadlocks.

### 113. What is a deadlock?
When several system threads compete for system resources, they are waiting for the other party to de-occupy a certain part of the resources. As a result, no one wants to unlock first, wait for each other, and the program cannot execute. This is a deadlock.

GIL lock global interpreter lock (only available in cython)

Role: Limit multi-thread execution at the same time, to ensure that only one thread executes at the same time, so the multi-thread in cython is actually pseudo-multithread!

So Python often uses coroutine technology instead of multithreading. Coroutine is a more lightweight thread.

The process and thread switching is determined by the system, and the coroutine is decided by our programmers themselves, and the switch under the module gevent is switched when it encounters time-consuming operations.

The relationship between the three: there are threads in the process, there are coroutines in the thread.


### 114. Multi-threaded interactive access data, if you access it, you will not access it?
How to avoid rereading?

Create a list of accessed data to store the data that has been accessed, and add a mutex lock. When multi-threaded accesses the data, first check whether the data is in the accessed list, and skip it if it already exists.

### 115. What is thread safety and what is a mutex?
Each object corresponds to a tag called a 'mutex lock' that is used to ensure that only one thread can access the object at any one time.

Multiple threads in the same process share system resources. Multiple threads operate on one object at the same time. One thread operation has not been completed yet, and another thread has already operated on it, resulting in an error in the final result. The operation object adds a mutex to ensure that each thread's operation on the object gets the correct result.

### 116. Talk about the following concepts: synchronous, asynchronous, blocking, non-blocking?
Synchronization: There are sequential executions between multiple tasks, and one execution can be performed after the next execution.

Asynchronous: There is no order between multiple tasks, which can be executed at the same time. Sometimes a task may need to obtain the result of another concurrently executed task when necessary. This is called a callback!

Blocking: If the caller is stuck, the caller cannot continue to execute, which means the caller is blocked.

Non-blocking: If it doesn't get stuck, you can continue to execute, that is, non-blocking.

Synchronous Asynchronous vs. Multitasking, blocking non-blocking relative to code execution.

### 117. What is a zombie process and an orphan process? How to avoid the zombie process?
Orphan process: The parent process exits. The child processes that are still running by the child process are orphan processes. The orphan process will be adopted by the init process (process number 1), and the init process will complete the state collection work for them.

Zombie process: The process uses fork to create a child process. If the child process exits and the parent process does not call wait to get waitpid to get the state information of the child process, then the process descriptors of the child process are still stored in the system and the process is a zombie process.

Ways to avoid zombie processes:

1.fork twice with the grandson process to complete the task of the child process

2. Use the wait() function to block the parent process

3. Using the semaphore, call waitpid in the signal handler so that the parent process does not need to block


### 118.Python process and thread usage scenarios?
Multi-process is suitable for CPU-intensive operations (cpu operation instructions are more, such as floating-point operations with more bits).

Multi-threading is suitable for IO-tight operations (more data read and write operations, such as crawlers)

### 119. Is the thread concurrent or parallel, is the process concurrent or parallel?
Threads are concurrent and processes are parallel;

Processes are independent of each other and are the smallest unit of system allocation resources. All threads in the same thread share resources.

### 120. Parallel and concurrency?
Parallel: Multiple tasks are running at the same time

It does not run at the same time, and there are cases of alternate execution.

Parallel libraries are implemented: multiprocessing

The libraries that implement concurrency are: threading

Programs that require more read, write, and reply tasks require a lot of IO operations, and IO-intensive operations use better concurrency.

A program with a large amount of CPU calculations, it is better to use parallelism.
### 121.IO Intensive and CPU intensive differences?
IO-intensive: The system is running, most of the situation is that the CPU is waiting for I/O (hard disk/memory) read/write.

CPU-intensive: Most of the time is used for calculations, and logic-determining programs such as CPU operations are called CPU-intensive.
### 122.python The principle of asyncio?
The asyncio library is a mechanism that uses python's yield to interrupt the context of the current function, encapsulating the selector to get rid of the complex callback relationship.

### 140. Understanding the Flask Blueprint?
Blueprint definition

Blueprint/Blueprint is a componentized approach to Flask applications that can share blueprints within an application or across multiple projects. The use of blueprints greatly simplifies the development of large applications and provides a centralized mechanism for registering services in applications for Flask extensions.

Blueprint application scenario:

Decompose an application into a collection of blueprints. This is ideal for large applications. A project can instantiate an application object, initialize several extensions, and register a collection of blueprints.

Register a blueprint on the app with a URL prefix and/or subdomain. The parameters in the URL prefix/subdomain are the common view parameters for all view functions under this blueprint (by default)
Register a blueprint multiple times with different URL rules in one application.

Provide template filters, static files, templates, and other features through blueprints. A blueprint does not have to implement an application or view function.

When initializing a Flask extension, register a blueprint in these cases.

Disadvantages of the blueprint:

You cannot unregister a blueprint after the application is created without destroying the entire application object.

Three steps to using a blueprint

1. Create a blueprint object
```python
Blue = Blueprint("blue",__name__)
```
2. Perform operations on this blueprint object, such as registering routes, specifying static folders, registering template filters...
```python
@blue.route('/')
Def blue_index():
    Return "Welcome to my blueprint"
```
3. Register this blueprint object on the application object
```python
App.register_blueprint(blue,url_prefix="/blue")
```

### 141. What is the difference between Flask and Django route mapping?
  In django, the route is the url in the project that the browser first accesses when accessing the server, and then the url in the application is found by the url in the project. These urls are placed in a list, and the rules for matching from the past are followed. In the flask, the route is provided to each view function through the decorator, and a url can be used for different functions depending on the request method.


## Django

### 142. What is wsgi, uwsgi, uWSGI?
WSGI:

The web server gateway interface is a set of protocols. Used to receive user requests and encapsulate the request for the first time, and then hand the request to the web framework.

The module that implements the wsgi protocol: wsgiref, essentially writes a socket server for receiving user requests (django)

Werkzeug, essentially writing a socket server for receiving user requests (flask)

Uwsgi:

Like WSGI, it is a communication protocol that is an exclusive protocol for uWSGI servers that defines the type of information being transmitted.
uWSGI:

Is a web server that implements the WSGI protocol, uWSGI protocol, http protocol

### 143. Comparison of Django, Flask, Tornado?
1. Django takes a big and full direction and develops efficiently. Its MTV framework, its own ORM, admin background management, its own sqlite database and development test server, to developers to improve the high development efficiency.
The heavyweight web framework is fully functional and provides a one-stop solution for developers to spend a lot of time on their choices.

Comes with ORM and template engine, supports non-official template engine such as jinja.

Owning ORM makes Django and relational database highly coupled. If you want to use a non-relational database, you need to use a third-party library.

Own database management app

Mature, stable, and highly efficient development. Compared to Flask, Django's overall closure is better, suitable for enterprise-level website development. Pioneer of the python web framework, rich in third-party libraries

2, Flask is a lightweight framework, free, flexible, and extensible, based on Werkzeug WSGI tools and jinja2 template engine

Suitable for small websites and APIs for web services. There is no pressure to develop large websites, but the architecture needs to be designed by itself.

The combination with relational databases is not weaker than Django, and the combination with non-relational databases is far superior to Django.

3, Tornado is a small and refined direction, superior performance, its most famous asynchronous non-blocking design

Tornado's two core modules:

Iostalem: Simple encapsulation of non-blocking sockets

Ioloop: Encapsulation of I/O multiplexing, which implements a singleton

### 144. What is the difference between CORS and CSRF?
What is CORS?

CORS is a W3C standard, the full name is "Cross-origin resoure sharing".
It allows the browser to issue an XMLHttpRequest request to the cross-origin server, thereby enabling the AJAX to use only the restrictions of homologous use.

What is CSRF?

The CSRF mainstream defense method is to generate a string of random tokens when the backend generates a form, which is built into the form and becomes a field. At the same time, the string token is placed in the session. Each time the form is submitted to the backend, it will check whether the two values ​​are consistent, so as to judge whether the form submission is trusted. After submitting once, if the page does not generate CSRF token, the token will be cleared. If there are new requirements, the token will be updated.
An attacker can fake a POST form submission, but he does not have a token built into the form generated by the backend. There is no token in the session to no avail.

### 145.Session,Cookie,JWT understanding
Why use session management?

As we all know, the HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol, which means that each request is an independent request, and there is no relationship between the request and the request. But in the actual application scenario, this approach does not meet our needs. For example, everyone likes to use the product, add the product to the shopping cart, consider the request separately, the server does not know who the product is, who should join the shopping cart? Therefore, the context of the request should actually contain the relevant information of the user. Each time the user makes a request, this small part of the additional information is also used as part of the request, so that the server can be specific according to the information in the context. The user operates. So the emergence of these technologies is a supplement to the HTTP protocol, which allows us to build a user-oriented WEB application using HTTP protocol + state management.

The difference between Session and Cookie

  Here I want to talk about sessions and cookies first, because these two technologies are the most common for development. So what is the difference between session and cookies? Personally think that the core difference between session and cookies is who maintains the extra information. When using cookies to implement session management, the user's information or other information we want to keep in each request is placed in the cookie, and the cookies are saved by the client, whenever the client makes a new request. , will bring a little cookie, the server will operate according to the information.
  When using session for session management, the client actually only stores a session_id sent by the server, and this session_id can restore all the required state information on the server. From this, it can be seen that this part of the information is Maintained by the server.
  
In addition, sessions and cookies have their own drawbacks:
    
The security of cookies is not good. Attackers can use local cookies to spoof or use cookies to conduct CSRF attacks. When using cookies, there are cross-domain issues under multiple domain names.
Sessions need to be stored on the server for a certain period of time, so when there are a large number of users, the performance of the server will be greatly reduced. When there are multiple machines, how to share the session will also be a problem. (redis cluster) That is to say, the first access by the user is server A, and the second request is forwarded to server B, and how server B knows its status. In fact, sessions are associated with cookies. For example, we can store session_id in cookies.

How does JWT work?

First, the user sends a login request, and the server matches according to the user's login request. If the matching is successful, the related information is put into the payload, and the algorithm is used to generate the token by the server's key. It is important to note that the secret_key is important. If this leaks, the client can tamper with the additional information sent, which is a guarantee of information integrity. After the token is generated, the server returns it to the client. The client can hand the token to the server at the next request. Generally speaking, we can put it in the Authorization header, so that cross-domain problems can be avoided.

### 146. Briefly describe the Django request life cycle
Generally, the user initiates a request to our server through the browser. This request will access the view function. If no data call is involved, then the view function returns a template, which is a web page to the user.
The view function calls the model hair model to go to the database to find the data, and then returns it step by step. The view function fills the returned data into the space in the template, and finally returns the page to the user.

1.wsgi, request the package and hand it to the web framework (Flask, Django)

2. Middleware, verify the request or add other relevant data in the request object, for example: csrf, request.session

3. Route matching matches different view functions according to different urls sent by the browser.

4. View function, the processing of business logic in the view function, may involve: orm, templates 

5. Middleware, processing the response data

6.wsgi, send the response to the browser

### 147. Using the restframework to complete the api send time zone
The current problem is to use django's rest framework module to do a get request send time and time zone information api
```python
Class getCurrenttime(APIView):
    Def get(self,request):
        Local_time = time.localtime()
        Time_zone =settings.TIME_ZONE
        Temp = {'localtime':local_time,'timezone':time_zone}
        Return Response(temp)
```
### 148.nginx, tomcat, apach to what?
Nginx (engine x) is a high-performance HTTP and reverse proxy server. It is also an IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. It works on OSI 7 layer, and the load is implemented: polling, IP_HASH, fair, session_sticky.
Apache HTTP Server is a modular server from the NCSAhttpd server
The Tomcat server is a free, open source web application server that is a lightweight application server and the first choice for developing and debugging JSP programs.

### 149. Please give us what you are familiar with the relational database paradigm, what is the role?
When designing a database, some of the specifications that are followed can be designed in accordance with the design specifications to design a database structure without data redundancy and data maintenance exceptions.

There are many specifications for the design of the database. Generally speaking, we only need to reach some of the specifications when setting up the database. These specifications are also called the three paradigms of the database. There are three, and there are other paradigms. We only need to do By satisfying the requirements of the first three paradigms, we can set up our database to meet our requirements. We can't all follow the requirements of the paradigm, but also consider the actual business usage, so sometimes we need to do some violations. Requirements.
1. The first paradigm of database design (most basic), basically all the paradigms of the database are in accordance with the first paradigm, and the table conforming to the first paradigm has the following characteristics:

All the fields in the database table have only a single attribute. The columns of a single attribute are composed of basic data types (integer, floating point, character, etc.). The designed tables are simple two-dimensional tables.

2. The second paradigm of database design (designed on the basis of the first paradigm) requires that a table has only one business primary key, that is, a table that conforms to the second normal form cannot exist in the non-primary key column pair only Primary key dependency

3. The third paradigm of database design, that means that each non-primary attribute is neither partial nor dependent on the business primary key, that is, the second paradigm eliminates the transfer dependence of the non-primary attribute on the primary key.

### 150. Briefly describe the QQ login process
Qq login, divided into three interfaces in our project,

The first interface is to request the qq server to return a qq login interface;

The second interface is verified by scanning code or account login. The qq server returns a code and state to the browser. The code is used to obtain the access_token from the local server through the local server and return it to the local server. The access_token is used to obtain the user from the qq server. Openid (the unique identifier of the openid user)

The third interface is to determine whether the user is the first qq login. If not, directly log in the returned jwt-token to the user. For users who have not bound the website, encrypt the openid to generate a token for binding.

### 151. What is the difference between post and get?
1. GET is to get data from the server, POST is to transfer data to the server

2. On the client side, the GET method submits the data through the URL, the data can be seen in the URL, the POST method, the data is placed in the HTML - HEADER submission

3. For the GET method, the server uses Request.QueryString to get the value of the variable. For the POST method, the server uses Request.Form to get the submitted data.


### 152. The role of the log in the project
First, the log related concepts

1. Log is a way to track events that occur when certain software is running.

2. Software developers can call logging related methods in their code to indicate that something has happened.

3. An event can be described by a message containing optional variable data

4. In addition, the event also has the concept of importance, and this importance can also be called the severity level.

Second, the role of the log

1. Through the analysis of the log, it is convenient for the user to understand the operation of the system or software and the application;

2. If your application log is rich enough, you can analyze the past user's operating behavior, type preference, geographical distribution or other more information;

3. If the log of an application is also divided into multiple levels, then the health status of the application can be easily analyzed, the problem can be found in time, the problem can be quickly located, the problem can be solved, and the loss can be remedied.

4. Simply put, we can know whether a system or software program is running normally by recording and analyzing logs, or it can quickly locate problems when the application fails. Not only in development, but also in the operation and maintenance of the log is very important, the role of the log can also be simple. Summarized as the following:

Program debugging

2. Understand the operation of the software program, is it normal?

3, software program operation failure analysis and problem location

4. If the application's log information is sufficiently detailed and rich, it can also be used for user behavior analysis.

### 153.django middleware use?
Django presets six methods in the middleware. The difference between the six methods is that different phases are executed, and the input or output is intervened as follows:

1. Initialization: no parameters are required, the server is called once in response to the first request, used to determine whether to enable the current middleware
```python
Def __init__():
    Pass
```
2. Before processing the request: Call on each request and return the None or HttpResponse object.
```python
Def process_request(request):
    Pass
```
3. Before processing the view: Call on each request, return a None or HttpResponse object.
```python
Def process_view(request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs):
    Pass
```
4. Before processing the template response: Called on each request, returning the response object that implements the render method.
```python
Def process_template_response(request,response):
    Pass
```
5. After processing the response: All responses are called before returning to the browser, called on each request, and returning the HttpResponse object.
```python
Def process_response(request,response):
    Pass
```
6. Exception handling: Called when the view throws an exception, called on each request, returns an HttpResponse object.
```python
Def process_exception(request, exception):
    Pass
```
### 154.Talk about your understanding of uWSGI and nginx?
1. uWSGI is a web server that implements protocols such as WSGI, uwsgi, and http. The role of HttpUwsgiModule in Nginx is to exchange with the uWSGI server. WSGI is a web server gateway interface. It is a specification for communication between a web server (such as nginx, uWSGI, etc.) and a web application (such as a program written in the Flask framework).

Pay attention to the distinction between the three concepts of WSGI/uwsgi/uWSGI.

WSGI is a communication protocol.

Uwsgi is a line protocol rather than a communication protocol, which is commonly used for data communication between uWSGI servers and other network servers.

uWSGI is a web server that implements both uwsgi and WSGI protocols.

Nginx is an open source, high performance HTTP server and reverse proxy:

1. As a web server, it handles static files and index files very efficiently.

2. Its design is very efficient, supporting up to 50,000 concurrent connections, but only takes up very little memory space.

3. High stability and simple configuration.

4. Powerful reverse proxy and load balancing functions to balance the load pressure application of each server in the cluster

### 155. The respective application scenarios of the three frameworks in Python?
Django: It is mainly used for rapid development. His highlight is rapid development and cost saving. If you want to achieve high concurrency, you should redevelop django, for example, to remove the entire cumbersome framework and write your own socket. To achieve http communication, the underlying pure c, c++ write efficiency, the ORM framework to kill, write the framework of the package and database interaction, ORM although the object-oriented to operate the database, but its efficiency is very low, use the foreign key to contact the table Query with the table;
Flask: Lightweight, mainly used to write a framework of interfaces, to achieve separation between front and rear, to promote development efficiency, Flask itself is equivalent to a kernel, and almost all other functions use extensions (mail extension Flask-Mail, User authentication Flask-Login) needs to be implemented with third-party extensions. For example, you can use Flask-extension to join ORM, file upload, authentication, and more. Flask does not have a database that is used by default. You can choose MySQL or NoSQL.

Its WSGI toolkit uses Werkzeug (routing module) and the template engine uses Jinja2, which is also the core of the Flask framework.

Tornado: Tornado is an open source version of web server software. Tornado is clearly different from the current mainstream web server framework (including most Python frameworks): it is a non-blocking server and is quite fast. Thanks to its non-blocking approach and the use of epoll, Tornado can handle thousands of connections per second. Tornado is an ideal framework for real-time web services.
### 156. Where is the thread used in Django? Where is the coroutine used? Where is the process used?
1. Django's time-consuming tasks are performed with a process or thread, such as sending emails, using celery.

2. When deploying a django project, the configuration of the process and coroutine is set in the configuration file.

### 157. Have you used the Django REST framework?
The Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible web API tool. The reasons for using RESTframework are:

Web browsable API has great benefits for developers

Includes OAuth1a and OAuth2 authentication policies

Support for serialization of ORM and non-ORM data resources

Full custom development - if you don't want to use more powerful features, just use regular function-based views for extra documentation and strong community support
### 158. Understanding cookies and sessions? Can they be used alone?
Session uses a scheme to maintain state on the server side, while cookies use a scheme to maintain state on the client side. But disabling cookies will not get a session. Because the Session uses the Session ID to determine the server session corresponding to the current session, and the Session ID is passed through the cookie. Disabling the cookie is equivalent to the SessionID, and the session is not obtained.
